abstract = {We examine the late time behavior of the Bunch-Davies   wavefunction for interacting light fields in a de Sitter background.   We use perturbative techniques developed in the framework of   AdS/CFT, and analytically continue to compute tree and loop level   contributions to the Bunch-Davies wavefunction. We consider   self-interacting scalars of general mass, but focus especially on   the massless and conformally coupled cases.  We show that certain   contributions grow logarithmically in conformal time both at tree   and loop level.  We also consider gauge fields and gravitons. The   four-dimensional Fefferman-Graham expansion of classical   asymptotically de Sitter solutions is used to show that the   wavefunction contains no logarithmic growth in the pure graviton   sector at tree level. Finally, assuming a holographic relation   between the wavefunction and the partition function of a conformal   field theory, we interpret the logarithmic growths in the language   of conformal field theory.}

 abstract = {We examine the modes of a scalar field in de Sitter space and construct quantum two-point functions. These are then used to compute a finite stress tensor by the technique of covariant point-splitting. We propose a renormalization ansatz based on the DeWitt-Schwinger expansion, and show that this removes all ambiguities previously present in point-splitting regularization. The results agree in detail with previous work by dimensional regularization, and give rise to an anomalous trace with the conventional coefficient. We describe how our treatment may be extended to more general situations.},
